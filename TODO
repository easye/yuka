Immediate:
 * Correct the implementation of dup opcodes based on type categories.
 * Implement rest of opcodes (from f2d).
 * Implement support for basic classes.
 * Test all opcode implementations.

Major:
 * Read all attributes (for fields, methods, class etc). [p101]
 * Proper format checking and byte code verification. [p141]
